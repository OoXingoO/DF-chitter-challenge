Self-review
------
#### What have I learnt
- Insight into how back-end server interacts with the front-end to create a working full-stack application.
- Using mongoDB database to request and submit data.
- Using Express Validator for sanitisation of data submitted in requests.
- Using Mocha and Chai for server & database testing.

#### What could I do differently?
- To deploy my application on the web server.
- To use https for more secure web browsing.
- To have safer loggin and register system through encryption of passwords and using JSON web tokens as a way for authenticating user requests.

#### What additional/enhanced features could I add to develop this project further?
- To be able to reply to a peep from another user.
- To be able to receive notifications via email if tagged in a peep.
- To add imaging and video functions.
- To have like function on each peep.
